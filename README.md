# Resume Backend
branch test
This is the backend API for my mobile resume app found on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justin.resume It provides information about my experience with the various programming languages. Simply long click on the button, with your internet turned on, and the information will be downloaded and displayed.

This backend is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

*Disclaimer: The api itself is not functional because of missing files left out intentionally. This repo is more designed as a snippet of the work I’ve done and allows others to view the work I’ve disclosed in my resume.*

*If you have any questions or would like to provide feedback, please e-mail me at jkatzwhitew@gmail.com*
